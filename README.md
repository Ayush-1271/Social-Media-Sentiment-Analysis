# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis

Here's a breakdown of each module::

1. data_loader.py: Handles data loading and preprocessing
2. text_processor.py: Manages text cleaning and vectorization
3. sentiment_model.py: Implements the sentiment analysis model
4. time_series_analysis.py: Contains time series analysis using both LSTM and ARIMA
5. main.py: Orchestrates the entire analysis pipeline
6. requirements.txt: Lists all required dependencies

the solution include

Text preprocessing with NLTK
TF-IDF vectorization for text features
Random Forest for sentiment classification
LSTM and ARIMA models for time series prediction
Proper train-test splitting
Model evaluation metrics

how to run?

1. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Place your sentimentdataset.csv in the same directory
3. Run python main.py
